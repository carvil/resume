\section{EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY}
\vspace{0.1in}
  {\bf November 2013 \Minus Present}\\
  {\bf Co-Founder and CTO, ParcelBright, London, UK}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] I started \href{https://www.parcelbright.com/}{ParcelBright} as
        the lead developer building the initial proof of concept product and
        taking ownership of product development and hires.
      \item[] I built several integrations with 3rd party courier company
        APIs ranging from legacy APIs using XML and SOAP technologies, to
        systems where no HTTP APIs were available (reading/writing files to
        SFTPs, etc). I then aggregated these integrations into a single
        courier \href{https://github.com/parcelbright/api-docs}{API} provided by
        ParcelBright, with a modern HTTP interface.
      \item[] I also built the front-end website that allows most of our
        customers to book shipping labels and manage their entire orders. This
        sits on top of our API, using it to communicate with our partners.
      \item[] After our seed round, I expanded the tech and support teams
        and made sure we could scale the business product and tech-wise.
      \item[] Finally, I have been involved with customer interviews, meetings
        with partners and investors and most aspects of the business.
      \item[] In terms of technologies, I worked with:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[] {\bf Languages/Frameworks/APIs:} ruby (2.x.x), rails
          (4.x.x), clojure, coffeescript, javascript, ember.js and CSS (SASS)
        \item[] {\bf DBs/stores:} postgresql, redis and elasticsearch
        \item[] {\bf Tools/Infrastructure:} heroku, travis-ci, git, github and
          AWS
        \item[] {\bf OSs:} mac osx and linux
        \item[] {\bf Testing:} rspec, capybara, cucumber and midje
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  {\bf July 2013 \Minus September 2014}\\
  {\bf Senior Software Engineer, Forward Partners UK, London, UK}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] At Forward Partners, I worked with a number of different
        startups at different stages of their growth, from early stage companies
        up to companies on their series A funding round.
      \item[] During my employment, I advised startups such as
        snaptrip.com and driftrock.com on the technical side, I helped
        accelerating the development of companies such as appearhere.co.uk
        and I have been the technical co-founder of ParcelBright, a
        company focusing on smart parcel delivery for businesses.
      \item[] Up until now, I witnessed both successes and some failures.
        This experience gave me a solid understanding of how to help startups
        avoiding common pitfalls and therefore help them get to where they
        need to be.
      \item[] In terms of technologies, I worked with:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[] {\bf Languages/Frameworks/APIs:} ruby (2.x.x), rails
          (4.x.x), amqp, coffeescript, javascript, CSS (SASS)
        \item[] {\bf Messaging:} rabbitmq
        \item[] {\bf DBs/stores:} postgresql, mondodb, redis
        \item[] {\bf Tools/Infrastructure:} heroku, travis-ci, git, github
        \item[] {\bf OSs:} mac osx
        \item[] {\bf Testing:} rspec, capybara, cucumber
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  {\bf April 2013 \Minus June 2013}\\
  {\bf Senior Software Engineer, Listora, London, UK}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] I worked on the backend infrastructure of an events listing site,
      where I developed:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Backend services in Clojure responsible for parsing XML feeds and
        producing events and venues which would then be added to a RabbitMQ
        queue for further processing (Clojure was used for performance reasons,
        given the size of the XML files);
        \item Backend services in Ruby, which would aggregate the events and
        venues from the Clojure processes, store them in a database for future
        use and message them across to the main application;
        \item The front-end application, in Ruby on Rails, where the events and
        venues would be consumed, stored and presented. The site's search
        engine was supported by ElasticSearch.
      \end{itemize}
      In terms of technologies, I worked with:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[] {\bf Languages/Frameworks/APIs:} ruby (1.9.x and 2.x.x), rails
          (4.x.x), clojure, amqp, coffeescript, javascript
        \item[] {\bf Messaging:} rabbitmq
        \item[] {\bf DBs/stores:} postgresql and mondodb
        \item[] {\bf Tools/Infrastructure:} heroku, travis-ci, git, github and
          elasticsearch
        \item[] {\bf OSs:} mac osx
        \item[] {\bf Testing:} rspec, capybara, cucumber
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  {\bf August 2011 \Minus March 2013}\\
  {\bf Senior Software Engineer, Digital Science, London, UK}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] I worked on the central department, building both
      applications and infrastructure automation tools. I authored and worked
      in several different projects, from which I highlight:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item User management and authentication \href{https://auth.digital-science.com/}{system} \Minus a central user management
        system built using Ruby on Rails, which acts as an OAuth 2 provider for
        our products/applications. It holds user details, subscription data and
        an admin view to check statistics on user signups, oauth2 application
        tokens, API tokens, among other things;
        \item Internal web application for deployments and AWS instance management \Minus rails application with an ember.js front-end and connections to Jenkins and the Github API;
        \item A server orchestration tool (ruby \href{https://rubygems.org/gems/baton}{gem} and blog \href{http://www.digital-science.com/blog/posts/presenting-baton}{post}) – an asynchronous tool based on RabbitMQ and EventMachine that was the base for building a custom deployment tool;
        \item A RESTful API built on top of Sinatra with a Riak backend, which exposes metadata from scientific articles processed by a processing pipeline; the API is then used in visualization tools being developed internally using D3.js;
        \item New version of the \href{http://altmetric.com}{Altmetric} processing pipeline \Minus a distributed application using twitter’s Storm to process tweets and perform several calculations ranging from simple counting of hashtags to web scraping for scientific metadata;
        \item Front-end dashboard for the pipeline above \Minus displays several D3.js visualisations of the data collected on top of Rails (top domains, tweets containing scientific content, among others);
        \item MVP for a grants’ analytics tool \Minus processing pipeline to process different grants’ formats into a common format and a set of D3.js visualisations to explore the data (on top of Rails);
        \end{itemize}
      Besides, I was responsible for code review, best practices such as code standards, good documentation, how to create Hypermedia APIs and finally interviewing new candidates.

      \end{itemize}
  {\bf January 2011 \Minus August 2011}\\
  {\bf Software Developer, Mobile Interactive Group, London, UK}
       \begin{itemize}
        \item[] During my employment at MIG, I was mainly working with Ruby technologies developing both backend RESTful APIs and frontend applications, from which I highlight:
          \begin{itemize}
          \item A mobile site with a RESTful Rails API to present rewards to customers of a well-known mobile operator with data exchange functionality;
          \item A backend Sinatra application that acts as a proxy between a number of RESTful APIs and an operator’s SOAP API.
          \end{itemize}

        Besides the systems mentioned above, I worked with many other systems, mainly solving production problems and improve system’s availability by fixing/enhancing the existing functionality. Technology wise, I used ruby (1.8.7, EE and 1.9.x), rails (2.x and 3.x), sinatra, mysql, web stack (html, css, javascript), perl, RVM.

In terms of technologies, I developed mainly with core Java (J2SE), Eclipse IDE, Eclipse plug-ins, Eclipse RCP, maven (build manager), VDM++, VDM-SL (functional language), Java Modelling Language, ANTLR for parser generation, design patterns such as the Visitor Pattern, deep language manipulation and representation (experience with abstract syntax trees), semantic analysis, formal modelling, unit and combinatorial testing, among others.
       \end{itemize}

  {\bf Oct 2007 \Minus Apr 2008}\\
  {\bf Software Developer, Callis ApS, Denmark}
        \begin{itemize}
